    <h2>How to Make Pistachio Cake</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li><b>Make Pistachio Powder</b>
            <ol type="a">
                <li><b>Toast the pistachios</b> in the oven for 12 minutes or until they smell nutty
                    <br>and they are crisp (eat to check).</li>
        <li><b>Blitz - </b>Let them cool completely then blitz into a powder. It's very quick
            <br>using a NutriBullet as I do - literally <small>2 x 2</small> second pulses. Some pistachios
        <br>lumps are okay/welcome, but you want it to be at least <small>95%</small> powder.
    <br><br>‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful not to let the pistachios turn into a paste which will happen
    <br>if you blitz for too long.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><b>Make the Pistachio Cake</b>

        <ol type="a">
            <li><b>Break Up Pistachio Clumps - </b>Whisk the pistachio powder with the flour.
            <br>Then use your fingers to break up any obvious pistachio powder clumps
        <br>into a powder i.e. where pistachio powder has gotten a bit pasty so they
    <br>stick together. Adding flour makes this step easier because if you pinch
<br>the plain pistachio powder, it sticks together into a paste. Some small
<br>clumps remaining are fine, they will dissolve in the oven.
<br><br>The whisk in remaining dry ingredients (baking powder, baking soda, salt).</li>

        <li><b>Whisk Wet - </b>Pull all the wet ingredients into a separate medium bowl.
            <br>Then whisk until combined.
        </li>

<li><b>Combine Wet and Dry - </b>Pour the wet inredients into the dry ingredients.
    <br>Use a rubber spatula to mix them together but <strong>stop</strong> when the flour is just
    <br>about mixed in. (Why? Because overmixed batter = tough cake, and we
    <br>still have extra mixing to come when we add the food colouring.)
</li>

<li><b>Make It Pistachio Green!</b> Add <small>4</small> small drops of green food colouring and
<br>mix it in. Goal - pistachio green colour. (Note: the cake becomes slightly
<br>darker in colour once baked, see above for raw batter vs cooked cake
<br>comparison.) Then mix until the batter is fully combined. You may have
<br>some small lumps from pistachio powder clumps (these will dissolve in 
<br>the oven) and a few random whole bits of pistachio.
<br><br>‚ö†Ô∏è If using gel rather than liquid colouring which is much more intense,
<br>use a tiny toothpick smear instead. See recipe card notes for directions. 
<br>üí° We add the food colouring in this step because bizarrely, I found the 
<br>colouring doesn't work as well if mixed in with the wet ingredients, I 
<br>needed double the amount of colouring. I can't explain it, I just know 
<br>what I experienced!</li>

<li><b>Pour the batter</b> into a lined pan then spread it out in the pan. You don't 
<br>need to smooth the surface perfectly because the batter will spread in the oven. 
<br><br>üí°<b> Tip: </b> Because it's a thickish batter, I prefer to grease the pan with butter 
<br>rather than oil spray. This is because butter makes the paper stick more 
<br>firmly to the pan so it won't slide as you spread the batter.</li>

<li><b>Bake</b> for 40 minutes at 180¬∞C/350¬∞F (160¬∞C fan-forced), rotating at the 30
<br>minute mark so the cake browns evenly on the surface. The cake is ready
<br>when a skewer inserted into the centre comes out without a batter smear
<br>(although it will be a wet because this is a damp cake).
<br><br><b>Cool completely</b> before spreading on the Cream Cheese Whip, else it
<br>will melt! 10 minutes in the pan then about 1 hour on a rack.</li>
</ol>
<li><b>Making the Cream Cheese Whip</b>
<ol type="a">
    <li><b>Cream Cheese First - </b> Beat the cream cheese until soft and fluffy. Take a 
    <br>good 2 minutes on medium high speed to d this so you cream it really 
<br>well. This is important because the cream is cold so it won't blend in 
<br>easily with the cream cheese (i.e. when you whip the cream, it can cause 
<br>cream cheese lumps). To avoid this problem, you want to beat the cream 
<br>cheese until it is really soft and creamy so it mixes in seamlessly with the 
<br>cream.</li>
<li><b>Whip Cream - </b>Then add the cream, sugar, lemon, vanilla and salt, and 
<br>beat until the cream is whipped. This frosting will look and behave like
<br>regular whipped cream, but it is a little richer thanks to the cream cheese.
<br>(Which is why it will stay fluffy for days rather than weeping like regular
<br>cream).</li>
<li><b>Spread</b> the frosting onto the cake, making lovely big swirl patterns. A 
<br>small offset spatula makes short work of this (handy tool for 
<br>cake frosting).</li>
<li><b>Sprinkle</b> with finely chopped pistachios. And now the moment has
    <br>arrived - yes, let's eat it!</li>
