# odin-recipes

This current project will be the first of many from The Odin Project.
The project's premise is a website that consists of a basic recipe of a meal.

This will act as a refresher for my HTML knowledge and a starting point of my self-study
journey towards becoming a great coder.

I will put the work in 4x a week for a couple of hours each day until I hit peak repetition.

Reps remove doubts.

I'm here to build my coding confidence!!
